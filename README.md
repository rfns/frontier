# Frontier

Frontier is an abstraction layer for rapid web application development with Cach√©. By using it you'll stop worrying about how to handle data and errors thus focusing on what matters: your application.

# Features

* __Automatic exception handling:__ Handles the exception feedback accordingly when it's thrown. Recommended to be used along with status to notify the consumer application about errors.

```
ClassMethod TestPOSTInvalidPayload() As %String
{
  // This will be thrown and be captured.
  return idontexist
}
```

* __Typed parameter instantiation:__ Parameters that are typed from %Persistent classes can be resolved and instantiated right at the runtime. Invalid ids are represented by empty values.

```
ClassMethod TestGETRouteParams(class As Frontier.UnitTest.Fixtures.Class) As %Status
{
  // curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" 'localhost:57772/api/frontier/test/route_params/6'
  // {"Plate":"O5397","Students":[{"Name":"Drabek,Peter T.","__id__":"20"}],"__id__":"6"}
  return class
}
```

* __Support for query parameters:__ Can be used by simply defining their formal spec and passing them in the URL.

```
ClassMethod TestGETOneQueryParameter(msg As %String) As %String
{
  // curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" 'localhost:57772/api/frontier/test/query_params?msg=hello'
  // {result":"hello"}
  return "hello"
}
```

* __Support for rest parameters:__ If more flexibility is needed for a single query parameter, using rest parameters might be better. Define them as it would be using common COS syntax and populate it using queryN syntax, where N is a sequential index.

```
ClassMethod TestGETRestParametersSum(n... As %String) As %Integer
{
  // curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" 'localhost:57772/api/frontier/test/rest_params?n1=10&n2=20&n3=30'
  // {"result":60}
  set sum = 0
  for i=1:1:n  set sum = sum + n(i)
  return sum
}
```

* __Automatic payload detection (can also be an array):__ Applications requiring to send payload data (normally JSON), can do so with methods whose parameters are typed from %Dynamic instances.

```
ClassMethod TestPOSTObjectPayloadSingle(payload As %DynamicObject) As %DynamicObject
{
  // curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"username":"xyz","password":"xyz"}' 'http://localhost:57772/api/frontier/test/payload/single_object'
  // {"username":"xyz","password":"xyz"}
  return payload
}
```

* __Request rules enforcement:__ Makes sure that the developer is following the correct practices for welcoming requests.
```
ClassMethod TestPOSTInvalidPayload(
  payloadA As %DynamicArray,
  payloadB As %DynamicObject) As %DynamicArray
{
  // curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '[{"username":"xyz","password":"xyz"}]' 'http://localhost:57772/api/frontier/test/payload/invalid'
  // Throws because requests can only have one payload.
  return payloadA
}
```

* __Request context instance:__ Can be used to modify certain behaviors and produce different results.
```
ClassMethod TestGETRawMode() As %String
{
  do %frontier.Raw()
  // Content-Type is now text/plain, response is plain as well.
  return "hello raw response"
}
```

* __SQL support:__ SQL results can be serialized by using the Frontier's SQL API. Named queries are supported as well.
```
ClassMethod TestGETDynamicSQLResult(
	page As %Integer = 1,
	rows As %Integer = 5) As Frontier.SQL.Provider
{
  set offset = (page * rows) - (rows - 1)
  set limit = page * rows

  return %frontier.SQL.Prepare(
    "SELECT *, %VID as Index FROM (SELECT * FROM FRONTIER_UNITTEST_FIXTURES.STUDENT) WHERE %VID BETWEEN ? AND ?"
  ).Parameters(offset, limit)
}
```

* __Stream support:__ Big contents can be serialized by returning a %Stream.Object instance.

```
ClassMethod TestGETStream() As %Stream.Object
{
  set stream = ##class(%Stream.GlobalCharacter).%New()
  do stream.Write("This line is from a stream.")

  return stream
}
```

*  __Seamless marshalling procedure:__ Normalizes the instance graphs by marshalling them into %Dyanamic instances before serialization.

```
ClassMethod TestGETMixedDynamicObject(class As Frontier.UnitTest.Fixtures.Class) As %DynamicObject
{
  // curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:57772/api/frontier/test/mixed/object?class=1
  return {
    "class": (class)
  }
}
```

## I want to see this demo running!

You're in luck! Just import the class [Frontier.UnitTest.WebApplicationInstaller](https://github.com/rfns/frontier/blob/master/cls/Frontier/UnitTest/WebApplicationInstaller.cls) and use some browser or tool like cURL to see it in action.

## How do I create my own router?

Just like you would [do](http://docs.intersystems.com/latest/csp/docbook/DocBook.UI.Page.cls?KEY=GREST_preface) with %CSP.REST.

But instead of extending your router from %CSP.REST you use ```Frontier.Router.```

Still with doubts? The [class](https://github.com/rfns/frontier/blob/master/cls/Frontier/UnitTest/Router.cls) demo'ed on Features is available to check out.

## So, what's next?

- [v] SQL support.
- [ ] Easier credentials validation and user object access.
- [ ] Request error email reporter.
